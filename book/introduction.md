The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king. I dunno. Must be a king.

## I'm not a witch. I am your king.

Shut up! Well, we did do the nose. No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place.

We want a shrubbery!! Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Well, I got better. I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!

__We shall say 'Ni' again to you__, if you do not appease us. What do you mean? Did you dress her up like this? Burn her anyway! We want a shrubbery!!

Why do you think that she is a witch? Well, I didn't vote for you. Why? No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!

You don't vote for kings. Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. Well, how'd you become king, then? Burn her!

We want a shrubbery!! Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! â€¦Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? He hasn't got shit all over him. You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!
