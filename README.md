# Norsk: 1000 questions — 1000 answers in Norwegian

## Why?

Oh, I just wanted to code an online book, try Svelte, and learn some ~Norwegian~ French. The idea is based on [1000 Questions 1000 Answers](https://lexika.hu/angol/tankonyvek/1000-questions-1000-answers-4ed), a hugely successful book written by an English teacher I’ve had the honour to meet several times while attending courses at her language school.

## The tech

Written in [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/), powered by [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). Code style is [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/), because it’s my own project and I get to do whatever I want, even omit semicolons! Fat chance doing that at work.

## Development

Start server: `yarn dev`

Format: `npx standard --fix`
